# 打工文化艺术博物馆 The Culture and Arts Museum of Migrant Labors

改革开放三十年来，中国的工业化、城市化、经济建设飞速发展，这其中离不开我们亿万打工兄弟姐妹们所付出的劳动和贡献。
从乡村到城市，流动打工群体是城乡的纽带和桥梁、是推动中国社会前进的新型劳动大军、是中华民族的脊梁。

In the past thirty years since China first adopted reform policies which opened their doors to the world, China has developed extremely fast in the areas of industrialization, urbanization and economic development. The main reason for this development has been the backs of the two hundred million plus migrant workers who have played an indispensable role in the country's rise.

Moving from countryside to urban areas, migrant workers are the links and bridges between the two worlds, and are the driving forces of China's social progress. They are actually holding up the whole nation, and we wish to honor their history.

我们希望通过打工文化艺术博物馆来记录和反映我们劳动者自己的文化和历史。因为，没有我们的文化就没有我们的历史，没有我们的历史就没有我们的将来。

We hope that the Culture and Art Museum of Mirgrant Labors will be able to record and reflect the culture and history of migrant workers. If we do not keep a record of our culture then there is no record of our history. Without knowing our history we will not be able to build a future.

这也正是我们创办打工文化艺术博物馆和举办这次展览的目的——纪录打工群体的历史变迁，倡导劳动价值的尊重认可。

To summarize the purposes of creating thie museum:

- To record the history of migrant workers
- To advocate respect and recognition for the value of labor
